For USGS earthquakes `geometries` may contain ShakeMap polygons. They are derived
from contour lines published by USGS. If `shakemap` is an array, only
its first element is used. ShakeMap polygons do not include the original
`Class`, `country` or `areaType` attributes. Polygons whose `value` ends up
`null` are discarded during normalization. If `cont_mmi` contains no
`features` array, the polygons are skipped. Each polygon is enriched with
`Class`, `eventid`, `eventtype` and `polygonlabel` derived from the intensity
value. `Class` becomes `Poly_SMPInt_&lt;intensity&gt;`, `eventid` matches the
earthquake external ID, `eventtype` is `EQ` and `polygonlabel` is
`Intensity &lt;intensity&gt;`. If `maxpga` in ShakeMap properties reaches at
least `0.4` and the data provides `coverage_pga_high_res`, a union of
pixels with PGA above `0.4 g` is computed and stored as a GeoJSON object in
`severity_data` under the key `pga40Mask`.
If ShakeMap provides `coverage_pga_high_res`, it is copied to `severity_data` under `coverage_pga_highres`.
Polygons created from ShakeMap contours and the `pga40Mask` are shifted with `ST_ShiftLongitude` if they cross the antimeridian so that longitudes stay within `[-180, 180]`.
For every USGS earthquake a circular polygon with 100&nbsp;km radius is built around the epicenter. If this buffer crosses the antimeridian it is also shifted.
It is stored in `geometries` with properties `Class`=`Poly_Circle`, `eventid` equal
to the external ID, `areaType`=`alertArea`, `eventtype`=`EQ` and `polygonlabel`=`100km`.
